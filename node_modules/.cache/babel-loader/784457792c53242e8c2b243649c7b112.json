I am\n                        the nucleus.\n                        I think that’s a responsibility that I have, to push\n                        possibilities, to show people, this is the level that\n                        things could be at. So when you get something that has\n                        the name Kanye West on it, it’s supposed to be pushing\n                        the furthest possibilities. I will be the leader of a\n                        company that ends up being worth billions of dollars,\n                        because I got the answers. I understand culture.
